			Abeliophyllum (White Forsythia, or Korean
			Abelialeaf) is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in
			the olive family, Oleaceae. It consists of one species,
			Abeliophyllum distichum Nakai, endemic to Korea,
			where it is endangered in the wild, occurring at only
			seven sites. It is related to Forsythia, but differs in having
			white, not yellow, flowers.</p>
			<p>
			It is a deciduous shrub growing to 1–2 m tall. The leaves
			are opposite, simple, 6–10 cm long and 3-4.5 cm wide,
			pubescent both above and below. The flowers are pro-
			duced in early spring before the new leaves appear; they
			are white and fragrant, about 1 cm long, with a four-lobed
			corolla. The fruit is a round, winged samara 2–3 cm di-
			ameter.
			It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in Europe and North
			America.
